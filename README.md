## Data

Because of the diverse nature of the datasets employed by this project, we have separated our datasets into 2 directories: raw and synthesized. Raw data is datasets in their original downloaded form. Synthesized data has been cleaned, combined, and minimally pre-processed to prepare it for actual analysis

### Corn Crop Quality

The National Agricultural Statistics Service data portal only supports returning 50,000 results at a time, so the data had to be collected in 3 separate downloads.

* **corn_quality__excellent_fair.csv** - percentages of corn in excellent or fair condition
* **corn_quality__good_poor.csv** - percentages of corn in good or poor condition
* **corn_quality__verypoor.csv** - percentages of corn in very poor condition
